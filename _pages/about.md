My name is Muhammad Sarwar, and I am a dedicated PhD student and Graduate Research Assistant at the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Iowa State University in Ames, IA. With a strong academic background in Electrical Engineering, including a Master's and Bachelor's degree with honors, I have consistently demonstrated excellence and leadership in my field. My research focuses on voltage stability and the integration of inverter-based resources in power systems, utilizing advanced computational and artificial intelligence techniques. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable industry experience through multiple research internships at prestigious institutions such as the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL). I am an active member of several professional organizations, including IEEE, and have a notable record of publications and presentations in my area of expertise.
